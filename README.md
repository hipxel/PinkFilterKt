# PinkFilterKt

This filter generates pink noise values from white noise values (for example RNG floats in range [0:1)).
Values that come out from the filter can be input for Android's AudioTrack, it will produce sound that is audio pink noise( -3dB / octave).
To use it just add Kotlin code to your project and feed it with white noise.

You can check it out on Google Play, it is used in app: [Noise Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hipxel.noise)
